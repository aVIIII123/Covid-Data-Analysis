ðŸ“Š Excited to share my latest project on COVID Data Analysis from 2020 to 2023! ðŸ¦ 

The various steps involved are:

1. Data Set Collection: It all began with gathering relevant data sources, ensuring accuracy and completeness.

2. Loading and Transforming Data on SQL: I harnessed the power of SQL to efficiently store and manipulate the data, laying a strong foundation for analysis.

3. Data Cleaning and Transformation: Clean data is key! I meticulously cleaned and transformed the data using SQL and Excel to make it analysis-ready.

4. SQL Queries: Leveraging the full potential of SQL, I crafted complex queries, utilizing Common Table Expressions (CTE), creating views, and using subqueries to extract valuable insights. 

5. Building a Final Report on Power BI: The journey culminated in creating an interactive and insightful report using Power BI, presenting the data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format.
